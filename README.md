This is a significantly simplified codebase adapted from the [Eureka](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12931) paper. The dependencies on IsaacGym and Tensorboard have been removed. It utilizes OpenAI Gymnasium and Stable Baselines 3. The environment is a modified CartPole game where the cart must both balance the pole and swing back and forth periodically as quickly as possible. This project was developed as part of a class assignment. Gymnasium, Stable Baselines 3, Pillow, and OpenAI libraries are required to run the code.
