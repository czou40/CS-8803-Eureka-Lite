As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: def compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components\n.\nPlease make sure that the reward or its components are returned as np.float64, rather than float, int, np.ndarray, or any other type.The output of the reward function should consist of four items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) whether the episode is terminated,\n    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and\n    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.\n    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the \"self\" parameter in the function signature.

        "content": "Based on the policy feedback, let's analyze the reward components and then provide an improved reward function.\n\n1. **Pole Stability Reward**:\n   - The `pole_stability_reward` and its transformed version have high values but low variability, indicating that it is not effectively guiding the agent's behavior.\n   - Rescaling or altering the transformation approach might help improve this component.\n\n2. **Cart Position Penalty**:\n   - This component shows more variability but its absolute values are much lower compared to the pole stability components.\n   - Its scale should be increased to have a meaningful balance with other components.\n\n3. **Overall Reward**:\n   - The generated rewards differ greatly from the ground-truth rewards, suggesting the components are not balanced.\n   - Normalizing the reward could help align it better with expectations.\n\nHere's a new and improved reward function:\n\n```python\ndef compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:\n    # Unpack the state variables\n    cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity = internal_state\n\n    # Define thresholds for termination\n    angle_threshold = 12 * (np.pi / 180)  # 12 degrees in radians\n    position_threshold = 2.4\n\n    # Adjust pole stability reward, making it more sensitive\n    pole_stability_temperature = 1.5  # New temperature for transformation\n    pole_stability_reward = np.float64(1.0 - (abs(pole_angle) / angle_threshold))\n    pole_stability_reward_transformed = np.float64(np.exp(-pole_stability_temperature * abs(pole_angle)))\n\n    # Increase cart position penalty contribution\n    cart_position_scale = 2.0  # New, increased scale factor\n    cart_position_penalty = np.float64(-cart_position_scale * abs(cart_position / position_threshold))\n\n    # Normalize the cart position penalty to ensure reward is within a balanced range\n    cart_position_penalty = max(min(cart_position_penalty, 0), -1)\n\n    # Combination that emphasizes balance\n    stability_importance = 0.7\n    position_importance = 0.3\n\n    # Calculate total reward\n    total_reward = (\n        stability_importance * pole_stability_reward_transformed +\n        position_importance * cart_position_penalty\n    )\n\n    # Check for termination conditions\n    terminated = bool(abs(pole_angle) > angle_threshold or abs(cart_position) > position_threshold)\n    truncated = False  # Assume no episode truncation\n\n    # Compile reward components\n    reward_components = {\n        \"pole_stability_reward\": pole_stability_reward,\n        \"pole_stability_reward_transformed\": pole_stability_reward_transformed,\n        \"cart_position_penalty\": cart_position_penalty\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components\n```\n\n**Key Adjustments**:\n- **Pole Stability Reward**: The stability temperature parameter is now reduced to make the transformation more sensitive and lower in magnitude, preventing any single component from dominating.\n- **Cart Position Penalty**: This component got a scale increase and a capping technique to ensure it meaningfully influences the agent's behavior.\n- **Normalization and Weighting**: Introduced weights to balance the importance of pole stability and cart position, aiming to achieve a more intuitive overall reward signal.\n\nThese adjustments should provide a better balance between guiding the agent to keep the pole stable and penalizing incorrect cart positions."

Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:\n    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function\n    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider\n        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter\n        (b) Re-writing the reward component \n        (c) Discarding the reward component\n    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range\nPlease analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) whether the episode is terminated,\n    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and\n    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable.
