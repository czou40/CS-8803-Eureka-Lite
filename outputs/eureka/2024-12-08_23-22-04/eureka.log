To accomplish the task of balancing the pole on the cart so that the pole stays upright, we'll focus on encouraging small pole angles and penalizing large deviations. We may also encourage the cart to stay near the center to make the task more challenging and rewarding. Here's a possible reward function for this task:

```python
def compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    # Unpack the state variables
    cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity = internal_state

    # Define thresholds for termination
    angle_threshold = 12 * (np.pi / 180)  # 12 degrees to radians
    position_threshold = 2.4
    
    # Initialize reward components
    pole_stability_reward = np.float64(-abs(pole_angle))
    cart_position_penalty = np.float64(-abs(cart_position))

    # Normalize the pole stability component using a temperature parameter
    pole_stability_temperature = 1.0  # Adjust this based on desired sensitivity
    pole_stability_reward_transformed = np.float64(np.exp(pole_stability_reward / pole_stability_temperature))
    
    # Combine reward components
    total_reward = pole_stability_reward_transformed + cart_position_penalty

    # Check for termination conditions
    terminated = bool(abs(pole_angle) > angle_threshold or abs(cart_position) > position_threshold)
    truncated = False  # Assuming no episode truncation

    # Compile reward components
    reward_components = {
        "pole_stability_reward": pole_stability_reward,
        "pole_stability_reward_transformed": pole_stability_reward_transformed,
        "cart_position_penalty": cart_position_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components
```

Important notes:
- The `pole_stability_reward` directly penalizes deviations in the pole's angle.
- A transformation via `np.exp()` is applied to the pole stability reward with a tunable temperature parameter to encourage more upright balancing.
- A small penalty is imposed on the cart's position to incentivize staying near the center, although maintaining the pole upright is the priority.
- The reward function checks if the pole angle or cart position exceeds predefined thresholds to determine if the episode should be terminated.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.

Based on the feedback from training, let's analyze and improve each component:

1. **Pole Stability Reward**: 
   - The range of values for `pole_stability_reward` suggests it is contributing effectively, but optimization might be improved.
   - Consider normalizing it differently or using a different transformation function.

2. **Pole Stability Reward Transformed**:
   - Values plateau near the high end, suggesting it isn't significantly affecting policy after initial improvement.
   - Adjust the transformation's temperature to better differentiate smaller changes in pole stability.

3. **Cart Position Penalty**:
   - The range suggests it has a wide impact which may overshadow other components.
   - Scale it down so it doesn't overly influence the total reward.

4. **Improving the Reward Function**:
   - Use a different transformation for pole stability reward, possibly sigmoidal or linear to improve sensitivity.
   - Adjust temperature variables and consider an alternative metric for better feedback.

Here's the improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    # Unpack the state variables
    cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity = internal_state

    # Define thresholds for termination
    angle_threshold = 12 * (np.pi / 180)  # 12 degrees in radians
    position_threshold = 2.4

    # Initialize reward components
    pole_stability_reward = np.float64(1.0 - (abs(pole_angle) / angle_threshold))
    
    # Apply transformation with adjusted temperature
    pole_stability_temperature = 0.5  # Lower temperature for increased sensitivity
    pole_stability_reward_transformed = np.float64(np.exp(pole_stability_reward / pole_stability_temperature))
    
    # Rescale cart position penalty
    cart_position_scale = 0.1  # Scale factor to reduce its impact
    cart_position_penalty = np.float64(-cart_position_scale * abs(cart_position))

    # Combine reward components
    total_reward = pole_stability_reward_transformed + cart_position_penalty

    # Check for termination conditions
    terminated = bool(abs(pole_angle) > angle_threshold or abs(cart_position) > position_threshold)
    truncated = False  # Assume no episode truncation

    # Compile reward components
    reward_components = {
        "pole_stability_reward": pole_stability_reward,
        "pole_stability_reward_transformed": pole_stability_reward_transformed,
        "cart_position_penalty": cart_position_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components
```

**Changes Made**:
- Adjusted the transformation of the `pole_stability_reward` using a lower temperature to enhance its sensitivity.
- Rescaled the `cart_position_penalty` to ensure it does not overpower the pole stability reward.
- Used a linear proximity measure to make `pole_stability_reward` more directly reflect how well the pole is balanced.

    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.

Let's analyze the feedback from the current policy:

1. **Pole Stability Reward**:
   - Values are generally high, indicating the pole is often upright, but variations aren't significantly high.
   - Consider improving normalization to capture more subtle deviations in the angle.

2. **Pole Stability Reward Transformed**:
   - The transformed values are consistently high, reducing sensitivity to small changes.
   - Rescale or revise the transformation function to provide more granularity.

3. **Cart Position Penalty**:
   - The penalty values are low compared to other components, and its minimum is significant.
   - Adjust scaling to increase its relative impact on the total reward.

4. **General Observations**:
   - The reward from the generated code is consistently lower than the ground-truth reward.
   - Re-evaluate reward functions to make them more responsive to changes across all components.

Taking these observations into account, here's an improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    # Unpack the state variables
    cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity = internal_state

    # Define thresholds for termination
    angle_threshold = 12 * (np.pi / 180)  # 12 degrees in radians
    position_threshold = 2.4

    # Adjust pole stability reward
    pole_stability_reward = np.float64(1.0 - (abs(pole_angle) / angle_threshold))
    # Apply a linear transformation with adjusted sensitivity
    pole_stability_temperature = 2.0  # Higher temperature to make it more sensitive
    pole_stability_reward_transformed = np.float64(pole_stability_reward / pole_stability_temperature)

    # Enhanced cart position penalty calculation
    cart_position_scale = 0.5  # Increased scale factor for more balanced impact
    cart_position_penalty = np.float64(-cart_position_scale * abs(cart_position / position_threshold))

    # Calculate total reward
    total_reward = pole_stability_reward_transformed + cart_position_penalty

    # Check for termination conditions
    terminated = bool(abs(pole_angle) > angle_threshold or abs(cart_position) > position_threshold)
    truncated = False  # Assume no episode truncation

    # Compile reward components
    reward_components = {
        "pole_stability_reward": pole_stability_reward,
        "pole_stability_reward_transformed": pole_stability_reward_transformed,
        "cart_position_penalty": cart_position_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components
```

**Key Changes**:
- **Pole Stability Reward**: Modified transformation by scaling with a stricter temperature to increase resolution for small changes around upright position.
- **Cart Position Penalty**: Increased its importance by adjusting the scale factor, making sure it properly balances with the stability reward.
  
By recalibrating the reward components, we aim to provide more actionable feedback to improve learning.

Based on the provided feedback, let's analyze each reward component:

1. **Pole Stability Reward**:
   - The similarity of values over iterations suggests that it's not sensitive enough to small changes.
   - There is room for altering its calculation or scaling to improve sensitivity and variability.

2. **Pole Stability Reward Transformed**:
   - Similar to the stability reward, the transformed values are close over iterations.
   - Rescaling or using a more dynamic transformation might help in reflecting more meaningful differences.

3. **Cart Position Penalty**:
   - Has more variability, but its range is quite narrow compared to other components.
   - Consider increasing its impact to have a balanced effect in comparison to pole stability.

Given these observations, here's an improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    # Unpack the state variables
    cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity = internal_state

    # Define thresholds for termination
    angle_threshold = 12 * (np.pi / 180)  # 12 degrees in radians
    position_threshold = 2.4

    # Adjust pole stability reward to increase sensitivity with a new transformation
    pole_stability_temperature = 3.0  # Adjusted for improved sensitivity
    pole_stability_reward = np.float64(1.0 - (abs(pole_angle) / angle_threshold))
    pole_stability_reward_transformed = np.float64(pole_stability_reward * pole_stability_temperature)

    # Cart position penalty with increased impact
    cart_position_scale = 1.0  # Increased scale factor
    cart_position_penalty = np.float64(-cart_position_scale * abs(cart_position / position_threshold))

    # Calculate total reward
    total_reward = pole_stability_reward_transformed + cart_position_penalty

    # Check for termination conditions
    terminated = bool(abs(pole_angle) > angle_threshold or abs(cart_position) > position_threshold)
    truncated = False  # Assume no episode truncation

    # Compile reward components
    reward_components = {
        "pole_stability_reward": pole_stability_reward,
        "pole_stability_reward_transformed": pole_stability_reward_transformed,
        "cart_position_penalty": cart_position_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components
```

**Key Changes**:
- **Pole Stability Reward**: Changed transformation by adjusting the temperature for improved sensitivity, making it more responsive to angular changes.
- **Cart Position Penalty**: Increased scale to ensure it has an appropriate impact on the total reward.

These adjustments aim to better balance the rewards and ensure effective learning by making the components more impactful and varied.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.

Based on the policy feedback, let's analyze the reward components and then provide an improved reward function.

1. **Pole Stability Reward**:
   - The `pole_stability_reward` and its transformed version have high values but low variability, indicating that it is not effectively guiding the agent's behavior.
   - Rescaling or altering the transformation approach might help improve this component.

2. **Cart Position Penalty**:
   - This component shows more variability but its absolute values are much lower compared to the pole stability components.
   - Its scale should be increased to have a meaningful balance with other components.

3. **Overall Reward**:
   - The generated rewards differ greatly from the ground-truth rewards, suggesting the components are not balanced.
   - Normalizing the reward could help align it better with expectations.

Here's a new and improved reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    # Unpack the state variables
    cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_angular_velocity = internal_state

    # Define thresholds for termination
    angle_threshold = 12 * (np.pi / 180)  # 12 degrees in radians
    position_threshold = 2.4

    # Adjust pole stability reward, making it more sensitive
    pole_stability_temperature = 1.5  # New temperature for transformation
    pole_stability_reward = np.float64(1.0 - (abs(pole_angle) / angle_threshold))
    pole_stability_reward_transformed = np.float64(np.exp(-pole_stability_temperature * abs(pole_angle)))

    # Increase cart position penalty contribution
    cart_position_scale = 2.0  # New, increased scale factor
    cart_position_penalty = np.float64(-cart_position_scale * abs(cart_position / position_threshold))

    # Normalize the cart position penalty to ensure reward is within a balanced range
    cart_position_penalty = max(min(cart_position_penalty, 0), -1)

    # Combination that emphasizes balance
    stability_importance = 0.7
    position_importance = 0.3

    # Calculate total reward
    total_reward = (
        stability_importance * pole_stability_reward_transformed +
        position_importance * cart_position_penalty
    )

    # Check for termination conditions
    terminated = bool(abs(pole_angle) > angle_threshold or abs(cart_position) > position_threshold)
    truncated = False  # Assume no episode truncation

    # Compile reward components
    reward_components = {
        "pole_stability_reward": pole_stability_reward,
        "pole_stability_reward_transformed": pole_stability_reward_transformed,
        "cart_position_penalty": cart_position_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components
```

**Key Adjustments**:
- **Pole Stability Reward**: The stability temperature parameter is now reduced to make the transformation more sensitive and lower in magnitude, preventing any single component from dominating.
- **Cart Position Penalty**: This component got a scale increase and a capping technique to ensure it meaningfully influences the agent's behavior.
- **Normalization and Weighting**: Introduced weights to balance the importance of pole stability and cart position, aiming to achieve a more intuitive overall reward signal.

These adjustments should provide a better balance between guiding the agent to keep the pole stable and penalizing incorrect cart positions.

ground-truth reward: ['439.20', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00'], Max: 500.00, Mean: 493.92, Min: 356.00 
episode_length: ['439.20', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00'], Max: 500.00, Mean: 493.92, Min: 356.00 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.
