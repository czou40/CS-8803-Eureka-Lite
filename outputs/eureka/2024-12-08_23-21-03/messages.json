As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: def compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components\n.\nPlease make sure that the reward or its components are returned as np.float64, rather than float, int, np.ndarray, or any other type.The output of the reward function should consist of four items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) whether the episode is terminated,\n    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and\n    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.\n    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the \"self\" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the \"internal_state\" variable will be available to you.\n"

Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:\n    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function\n    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider\n        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter\n        (b) Re-writing the reward component \n        (c) Discarding the reward component\n    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range\nPlease analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) whether the episode is terminated,\n    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and\n    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable.
