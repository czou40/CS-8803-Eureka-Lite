Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 10000 time steps and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
pole_upright_reward: ['392.35', '343.09', '419.76', '460.07', '424.10', '434.47', '481.63', '484.13', '459.20', '457.49'], Max: 490.08, Mean: 435.63, Min: 180.94

ground-truth reward: ['428.40', '375.20', '443.80', '476.60', '442.00', '450.00', '495.20', '500.00', '476.00', '473.20'], Max: 500.00, Mean: 456.04, Min: 210.00 
episode_length: ['428.40', '375.20', '443.80', '476.60', '442.00', '450.00', '495.20', '500.00', '476.00', '473.20'], Max: 500.00, Mean: 456.04, Min: 210.00 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.
