Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.

After analyzing the feedback from the current reward function implementation, several areas can be improved:

1. **Angle Reward**: The range and temperature seem appropriate, however, it may be benefiting too much from stable situations rather than encouraging exploration. The range is quite spread out, meaning optimization is happening but might not be focusing enough on precision.

2. **Velocity Reward**: The velocity reward component is not aligning well with the game dynamics as its mean and spread appear similar to angle_reward. 

3. **Threshold Touch Reward**: This component shows very low values, indicating it is not being optimized meaningfully. The logic here might need more incentivization or adjustment to capture the more successful swinging behavior.

Let's create an improved reward function:

- Increase incentive for touching the left and right threshold by adding a consistent bonus in relation to episode length and success.
- Slightly adjust the temperature for cart velocity and ensure its scaling is more significant to provide better encouragement for swift movement.

```python
def compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    cart_position = internal_state[0]
    cart_velocity = internal_state[1]
    pole_angle = internal_state[2]
    pole_angular_velocity = internal_state[3]
    swing_threshold = internal_state[4]
    has_touched_left_threshold = internal_state[5] == 1.0
    has_touched_right_threshold = internal_state[6] == 1.0

    # Updated temperature parameters
    angle_temperature = 2.0
    velocity_temperature = 1.5  # lower temp for more influence
    threshold_touch_bonus = 10.0  # increased bonus

    # Reward for keeping the pole balanced
    angle_reward = np.exp(-angle_temperature * (abs(pole_angle) / 1.57))

    # Reward for encouraging high velocity swings
    cart_velocity_scale = 0.1  # increase the scale for better swing visualization
    velocity_reward = np.exp(-velocity_temperature * cart_velocity_scale * abs(cart_velocity))

    # Bonus for touching both thresholds during swing
    threshold_touch_reward = threshold_touch_bonus if has_touched_left_threshold and has_touched_right_threshold else 0.0

    # Termination conditions
    terminated = abs(pole_angle) > 1.57 or abs(cart_position) > 4.0

    truncated = False

    # Total reward combines weighted components
    total_reward = np.float64(0.6 * angle_reward + 0.3 * velocity_reward + 0.1 * threshold_touch_reward)

    reward_components = {
        'angle_reward': np.float64(angle_reward),
        'velocity_reward': np.float64(velocity_reward),
        'threshold_touch_reward': np.float64(threshold_touch_reward),
    }

    return total_reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components
```

In this revised function:

- **Angle Reward** remains important but has been slightly de-emphasized compared to the previous version to balance it against cart velocity optimization.
- **Velocity Reward** has adjusted temperature parameters to ensure dynamic motion is more favored, particularly with an appropriate scale adjustment.
- **Threshold Touch Reward** is significantly boosted to more robustly motivate success in reaching both boundaries, augmenting its effectiveness in developing optimal swing behavior.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.

Based on the feedback provided, it seems that:

1. **Angle Reward**: The angle reward component seems to be providing substantial values, indicating that it's being somewhat effective in encouraging the balancing of the pole. However, it could use better scaling relative to other rewards, as its peak values are closely tied to the success and episode lengths.

2. **Velocity Reward**: This component's values are similar to the angle reward and behave change as expected. It requires rebalancing with a potentially increased temperature to apply more optimization pressure and differentiate better obstacle crossing velocities.

3. **Threshold Touch Reward**: This reward component is quite unused with consistently low values, suggesting that it is not properly influencing the policy. Consider redefining or reweighting this reward for better effective use.

4. **Overall Reward vs. Ground-Truth Reward**: The current reward function's mean significantly lags behind the ground-truth reward. There might be a deeper issue with the current scaling or functionality of each component.

We'll implement a revised solution where adjustments are applied across components, particularly increasing influence on effective threshold touch actions:

```python
def compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    cart_position = internal_state[0]
    cart_velocity = internal_state[1]
    pole_angle = internal_state[2]
    pole_angular_velocity = internal_state[3]
    swing_threshold = internal_state[4]
    has_touched_left_threshold = internal_state[5] == 1.0
    has_touched_right_threshold = internal_state[6] == 1.0

    # Updated temperature parameters with more variance focus
    angle_temperature = 3.0
    velocity_temperature = 2.0
    threshold_touch_bonus = 15.0  # increased bonus to bring noticeable impact

    # Reward for keeping the pole balanced
    angle_reward = np.exp(-angle_temperature * (abs(pole_angle) / 1.57))

    # Reward for encouraging high velocity swings
    cart_velocity_scaling = 0.15  # slightly increased scaling
    velocity_reward = np.exp(-velocity_temperature * cart_velocity_scaling * abs(cart_velocity))

    # Relocated weight for threshold touch, focusing more on touching both boundaries
    if has_touched_left_threshold and has_touched_right_threshold:
        threshold_touch_reward = threshold_touch_bonus
    else:
        threshold_touch_reward = 0.0

    # Termination conditions
    terminated = abs(pole_angle) > 1.57 or abs(cart_position) > 4.0

    truncated = False

    # Total reward with adjusted weights across all components
    total_reward = np.float64(0.5 * angle_reward + 0.3 * velocity_reward + 0.2 * threshold_touch_reward)

    reward_components = {
        'angle_reward': np.float64(angle_reward),
        'velocity_reward': np.float64(velocity_reward),
        'threshold_touch_reward': np.float64(threshold_touch_reward),
    }

    return total_reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components
```

In this improved version:

- **Angle Reward**: Enhanced focus on pole balance by increasing the temperature value for higher discrimination.
    
- **Velocity Reward**: Scaled slightly up and adjusted temperature for more influence on velocity to enhance swing dynamics.
    
- **Threshold Touch Reward**: Re-weighted with a higher bonus for more noticeable rewards upon achieving full swing bounds, potentially encouraging broader exploration to touch both swing thresholds.

This reward function aims to address the previous feedback with an inclusive reweighting of components to foster improvements in policy learning performance.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.

After analyzing the feedback, we can make the following observations and updates:

1. **Angle Reward**: This component is performing well, as indicated by its high rewards. We should maintain its influence but might slightly lower the temperature to prevent saturation and allow further differentiation.
   
2. **Velocity Reward**: The values are similar to the angle reward, though its scale might be slightly higher. We'll slightly reduce the temperature to balance it with the angle reward.

3. **Threshold Touch Reward**: This appears under-optimized with consistently low values. We'll redefine it to provide rewards more continuously rather than as a binary bonus.

4. **Overall Reward Disparity**: The reward sum systematically underperforms the ground-truth reward. We'll re-tune weights and improve temperature values to approach an optimal global reward landscape.

Let's update the reward function with these considerations:

```python
def compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    cart_position = internal_state[0]
    cart_velocity = internal_state[1]
    pole_angle = internal_state[2]
    pole_angular_velocity = internal_state[3]
    swing_threshold = internal_state[4]
    has_touched_left_threshold = internal_state[5] == 1.0
    has_touched_right_threshold = internal_state[6] == 1.0

    # Updated temperature parameters
    angle_temperature = 2.5
    velocity_temperature = 1.5
    touch_temperature = 0.1

    # Reward for keeping the pole balanced
    angle_reward = np.exp(-angle_temperature * (abs(pole_angle) / 1.57))

    # Reward for encouraging high velocity swings
    velocity_reward = np.exp(-velocity_temperature * abs(cart_velocity / 4.0))

    # Continuous reward for the cart's proximity to swing thresholds
    proximity_to_threshold = max(0.0, 1.0 - abs(cart_position / swing_threshold))
    threshold_touch_reward = np.exp(-touch_temperature * (1 - proximity_to_threshold))

    # Termination conditions
    terminated = abs(pole_angle) > 1.57 or abs(cart_position) > 4.0

    truncated = False

    # Total reward with adjusted weights across all components
    total_reward = np.float64(0.4 * angle_reward + 0.3 * velocity_reward + 0.3 * threshold_touch_reward)

    reward_components = {
        'angle_reward': np.float64(angle_reward),
        'velocity_reward': np.float64(velocity_reward),
        'threshold_touch_reward': np.float64(threshold_touch_reward),
    }

    return total_reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components
```

In this new function:

- **Angle Reward**: The temperature is slightly reduced to allow more differentiation among good policies.

- **Velocity Reward**: By reducing its temperature, rewards are more balanced relative to angle rewards, encouraging rapid cart motion.

- **Threshold Touch Reward**: It is redefined to continuously reward the proximity to swing thresholds, encouraging achieving boundary touches reflectively without being binary.

This revised reward function aims to ensure each component remains influential and balanced, increasing the likelihood of achieving greater task success.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider

        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.

Based on the feedback received from the policy performance:

1. **Angle Reward**: Shows good performance with high maximum values, suggesting that it works well. However, we might increase the temperature slightly to sharpen its sensitivity and prevent high rewards early on.

2. **Velocity Reward**: Performing adequately but with a potential for improvement, especially since the max is considerably lower than the angle reward. Increasing its temperature could encourage more aggressive exploration.

3. **Threshold Touch Reward**: It performs quite well but may benefit from some adjustment since it's under-optimized in the minimum range. We'll refine it by incorporating additional conditional incentives.

4. **Overall Reward Comparison to Ground-Truth**: The generated reward lags behind the ground-truth reward, hinting that the combination and scaling of components may need revisions.

I'll provide a new reward function considering improvements stated above:

```python
def compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    cart_position = internal_state[0]
    cart_velocity = internal_state[1]
    pole_angle = internal_state[2]
    pole_angular_velocity = internal_state[3]
    swing_threshold = internal_state[4]
    has_touched_left_threshold = internal_state[5] == 1.0
    has_touched_right_threshold = internal_state[6] == 1.0

    # Updated temperature parameters
    angle_temperature = 3.0
    velocity_temperature = 2.0
    touch_temperature = 0.05

    # Reward for keeping the pole balanced
    angle_reward = np.exp(-angle_temperature * (abs(pole_angle) / 1.57))

    # Reward for encouraging higher velocity swings
    velocity_reward = np.exp(-velocity_temperature * (abs(cart_velocity - 2.0) / 4.0))

    # Reward for touching the thresholds, slightly larger to reinforce threshold touching
    if has_touched_left_threshold or has_touched_right_threshold:
        threshold_touch_reward = 1.0 + np.exp(-touch_temperature * abs(cart_position / swing_threshold))
    else:
        threshold_touch_reward = np.exp(-touch_temperature * (1 - abs(cart_position / swing_threshold)))

    # Termination conditions
    terminated = abs(pole_angle) > 1.57 or abs(cart_position) > 4.0

    truncated = False

    # Total combined reward with considered weights
    total_reward = np.float64(0.35 * angle_reward + 0.35 * velocity_reward + 0.3 * threshold_touch_reward)

    reward_components = {
        'angle_reward': np.float64(angle_reward),
        'velocity_reward': np.float64(velocity_reward),
        'threshold_touch_reward': np.float64(threshold_touch_reward),
    }

    return total_reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components
```

In summary, this revised function incorporates increased sensitivity for angular balance and velocity incentivizing. The threshold touch rewards incorporate a conditional adjustment for additional bonuses upon hitting designated boundaries. This approach aims to better delineate gameplay events and reward optimally for task mastery.
