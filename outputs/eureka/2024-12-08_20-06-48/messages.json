As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: def compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components\n.\nPlease make sure that the reward or its components are returned as np.float64, rather than float, int, np.ndarray, or any other type.The output of the reward function should consist of four items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) whether the episode is terminated,\n    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and\n    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.\n    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the \"self\" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the \"internal_state\" variable will be available to you.\n"

(2) The cart can move back and forth periodically between positions of -swing_threshold and swing_threshold as quickly as possible. (3) The game fails if the pole's angle exceeds 1.57 radians from the vertical line or if the cart moves outside the range of [-4.0, 4.0].

        "content": "Based on the feedback received from the policy performance:\n\n1. **Angle Reward**: Shows good performance with high maximum values, suggesting that it works well. However, we might increase the temperature slightly to sharpen its sensitivity and prevent high rewards early on.\n\n2. **Velocity Reward**: Performing adequately but with a potential for improvement, especially since the max is considerably lower than the angle reward. Increasing its temperature could encourage more aggressive exploration.\n\n3. **Threshold Touch Reward**: It performs quite well but may benefit from some adjustment since it's under-optimized in the minimum range. We'll refine it by incorporating additional conditional incentives.\n\n4. **Overall Reward Comparison to Ground-Truth**: The generated reward lags behind the ground-truth reward, hinting that the combination and scaling of components may need revisions.\n\nI'll provide a new reward function considering improvements stated above:\n\n```python\ndef compute_reward(internal_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, bool, bool, Dict[str, np.float64]]:\n    cart_position = internal_state[0]\n    cart_velocity = internal_state[1]\n    pole_angle = internal_state[2]\n    pole_angular_velocity = internal_state[3]\n    swing_threshold = internal_state[4]\n    has_touched_left_threshold = internal_state[5] == 1.0\n    has_touched_right_threshold = internal_state[6] == 1.0\n\n    # Updated temperature parameters\n    angle_temperature = 3.0\n    velocity_temperature = 2.0\n    touch_temperature = 0.05\n\n    # Reward for keeping the pole balanced\n    angle_reward = np.exp(-angle_temperature * (abs(pole_angle) / 1.57))\n\n    # Reward for encouraging higher velocity swings\n    velocity_reward = np.exp(-velocity_temperature * (abs(cart_velocity - 2.0) / 4.0))\n\n    # Reward for touching the thresholds, slightly larger to reinforce threshold touching\n    if has_touched_left_threshold or has_touched_right_threshold:\n        threshold_touch_reward = 1.0 + np.exp(-touch_temperature * abs(cart_position / swing_threshold))\n    else:\n        threshold_touch_reward = np.exp(-touch_temperature * (1 - abs(cart_position / swing_threshold)))\n\n    # Termination conditions\n    terminated = abs(pole_angle) > 1.57 or abs(cart_position) > 4.0\n\n    truncated = False\n\n    # Total combined reward with considered weights\n    total_reward = np.float64(0.35 * angle_reward + 0.35 * velocity_reward + 0.3 * threshold_touch_reward)\n\n    reward_components = {\n        'angle_reward': np.float64(angle_reward),\n        'velocity_reward': np.float64(velocity_reward),\n        'threshold_touch_reward': np.float64(threshold_touch_reward),\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, terminated, truncated, reward_components\n```\n\nIn summary, this revised function incorporates increased sensitivity for angular balance and velocity incentivizing. The threshold touch rewards incorporate a conditional adjustment for additional bonuses upon hitting designated boundaries. This approach aims to better delineate gameplay events and reward optimally for task mastery."
