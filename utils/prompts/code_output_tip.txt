The output of the reward function should consist of four items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) whether the episode is terminated,
    (3) whether the episode is truncated, and
    (4) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    (5) Most importantly, you should assume that the function does not belong to a class, so you should not include the "self" parameter in the function signature. Only the values provided in the "internal_state" variable will be available to you.
